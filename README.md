# Project_Made_For_Hackathon

This is a project which me and my team made for a Hackathon conducted by IIT Kharagpur.
In this project we made a Algorithmic trading model which takes the trading done by person into
account and check the loss and profit and calculates the profit.
Its a test model which has only data from 2018 to Jan 2022 so it is not applicable for todays date.
